# motion-toyproject

Motion planning toy project in Python. This repository provides a small, clean
codebase to study and extend motion planning algorithms in a 3D environment.

## Goals
- Random 3D world generation with box and sphere obstacles
- Random start/goal sampling
- 3D visualization utilities for debugging and demos
- Clear structure for refactoring, optimization, and learning-based extensions

## Quick start
Run the world demo:
```bash
python examples/world_demo.py
```

## Project layout
- `motion_planning/` core library
- `examples/` runnable demos

## Notes
- Visualization requires matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`).
- The world is intentionally minimal; extend as needed.
